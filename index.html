<h1>Microeconomic Theory at Michigan State University</h1>

The microeconomic theory research conducted at Michigan State is primarily applied theory.
The strength of the microeconomic theory area lies in its diversity and its focus on applications to a broad range of topics:
industrial organization, political economy, information economics, organization economics, and labor economics.
Faculty in other fields also conduct microeconomic theoretical research in behavioral economics,
development, trade, public economics, decision theory, and micro-founded macroeconomics.
The theory group has an external speakers seminar, an internal speakers brown bag, a reading group, and a range of graduate course offerings.

The core theory faculty are Jay Pil Choi, Jon Eguia, Thomas Jeitschko, Ce Liu, Arijit Mukherjee, and Hanzhe Zhang,
who actively participate in research and teaching activities.
In addition to the core theory group, many other faculty conduct microeconomic theoretical research in other fields,
such as Benjamin Bushong (in behavioral economics), Chris Ahlin (in development economics), Carl Davidson and Steve Matusz (in trade),
Jay Wilson (in public economics),
Antonio Galvao (at the intersection between decision theory and econometrics),
and Luis Araujo and Tony Doblas-Madrid (in micro-founded macroeconomics).
